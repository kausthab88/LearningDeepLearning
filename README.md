# LearningDeepLearning

**10th May 2023** - This repository will contain all the concepts, codes and notes that will form part of my deep learning course that I am under going from the Chang School of Continuing Studies in Toronto. The books that I will refer to are Deep Learning with Python by Chollet, Hands on Machine Learning with Scikit Learn, Keras and Tensorflow by Geron and Deep Learning by Ian Goodfellow.
